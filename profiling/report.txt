# Profiling of Kapusta's math library

## Assignment
Create a profiling program using your math library to calculate
the standard deviation of provided numbers.
The input is provided via `stdin`, numbers are divided by
whitespace character.

## Results of profiling
Graphs are located in the `graphs` directory, profiler outputs are in
the `profiler_outputs` directory.
We found out, that program calls lots of Python's built-in functions,
these functions are well optimized, so there is no reason to optimize it.

Almost 18% of processing time is spent in the `add()` function, we definitely
should optimize it.
In the function `pwr()` is 9% of time spend, it is also a good candidate
for optimization.

The rest of the time is spent in lots of other functions.
